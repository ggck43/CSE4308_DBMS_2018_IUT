SQL BASICS

•	How to open sql?

	Just write sqlplus in the command prompt!
	Or,  
	Search ‘run sql command line’ in the program search bar. 

•	How to connect to a database?

	Open sql, write

	CONNECT USERNAME/PASSWORD;
	Or
	Type 
hii
CONNECT

Then there will be prompt for username. Input the username. Then it will ask for password. But now if u type the password, it will not show the characters as oracle keeps it hidden. After inputting the password hit enter and see the system will be connected.

•	How to see existing users? 

First u have to connect to the database.
	
SELECT USERNAME FROM DBA_USERS; 
	
	To see the existing usernames sorted:
	
SELECT USERNAME FROM DBA_USERS ORDER BY USERNAME; 

To see in which date the user was created:

SELECT USERNAME, CREATED FROM DBA_USERS ORDER BY CREATED;

The default order is ascending. Do make it appear in descending order you have to use the following query:

SELECT USERNAME, CREATED FROM DBA_USERS ORDER BY CREATED DESC;
(Here desc stands for Descending).
	


 
When the new user is created, if you try to login with it, Login will be denied as the super user (system) has not given him the privilege to login. There are some privileges in oracle like:

	Create session,
	Connect,
	Resource, (to be able to create table and add data)
	DBA, (database admin privilege)
	Etc.…

•	How to grant session privilege?

 	GRANT CREATE SESSION TO USERNAME;
	Or 
	GRANT CREATE SESSION TO USERNAME WITH ADMIN OPTION.

	To give him both create session and resource privilege:
	
	GRANT CREATE SESSION, RESOURCE TO USERNAME;

To give all possible privilege at a single go, you can write:
	
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO USERNAME;

(This is strictly NOT RECOMMENDED as the new user might get some unwanted privileges!)
	

•	How to alter the system password in case of u forgotten it?

	CONN / AS SYSDBA     
	ALTER USER USERNAME IDENTIFIED BY NEWPASSWORD;	
	
	Or

CONN SYSTEM / PASSWORD AS SYSDBA 
ALTER USER USERNAME IDENTIFIED BY NEWPASSWORD;
